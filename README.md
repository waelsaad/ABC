ABC News Fetch Feed Test
============

# App Notes
- The App fetches data from a publically avilable API to fetch Just In news from ABC and display articles.
- The pics are just plain colors.
- PinLayout integrated using Swift Package Manager. PinLayout is (100 X better than SnapKit - In my Opinion) :]

# Tasks Completed

Tasks worked on:

- Create a completly fresh empty project and developed from scratch.

- Architect and implement the app using clean MVVM Design Pattern with Swift 5.0.
- Structure the application code folders.
- Decode and map modles using Codable.
- Simplify API End Points.
- Implement a Generic API Manager to handle any endpoint.
- Create a specific API client to retrieve Justin feed.
- Create Storyboard UI and custom TableViewCells to display data and decouple UI.
- Create ArticleViewController programmatically.
- Integrate PinLayout using Swift Package Manager to demonstrate skills with programmatic layout.
- Add a number of extentions including elegant ways to register for TableViewCells and many other features.
- Add Theme pattern.
- Added error handling using within one generic function to reduce amount of code.
- Add Localized file for API Errors, and UI.

- Add unit tests using Quick and Nimble

# Additonal UI Features

The Following are new features developed:

- Avoided using too many 3rd party libraries with the exception of the use of PinLayout

# Instructions
- Implemented using Xcode Version 12.3 (12C33) and Swift 5.0.
- Simply open the workspace, PinLaout is integrated using the native Swift Package Manager just wait a few seconds until it automatically fetches the library.
- No Errors or Warnings.
- Attention to details :]

Please Note:

- I have used Carthage and CocoPods in many projects in the past but I decided to try out the native Swift Package Manager, please refer to other code challenges on my github if required.
